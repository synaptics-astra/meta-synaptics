Subject: [PATCH 015/168] egl/wayland: flush the drawable before blitting

Flush the drawable before blitting in the "is_different_gpu" case when
swapping buffers, and pass the flush flag to the blitImage call. The
change brings the code into line with the way the DRI3 GLX code works.

For the PowerVR driver, the drawable parameters that will be used in
the flush have been obtained previously, including any native fence
associated with the blit source. The blit will result in a new native
fence for the source, and make the one in the drawable parameters
invalid.
